<i>The staff are good and co operative. They white pasta was very good and tasty. The ice tea was also very good. The serving was very neat and good. The best place to sit there is the open balcony at night the winds which blow are awesome.<br> The best thing over there is the Nutella waffle. It is very tasty. Its is better than all waffles like chocolate.</i><br><br><br>
